## Our Project Idea 
- Our idea is to create a Machine Learning model which can be used to minimize this problem. To deal with Credit Card Fraud, we are trying to create a model which can be used to find any unusual money transaction that have done in a limited time period. For this, we have used credit card transaction data set with a fraud flag. our model will shortlist this bank account and track its record for furthermore time. So if in case we can send these information to the higher authorities.
